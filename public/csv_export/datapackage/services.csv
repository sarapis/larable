After a popular adult education program was threatened with closing without notice, students gathered together to protest the budget cuts and quickly learned that there is strength in numbers!   They learned they can accomplish more together than alone.  

This strong community of self-advocates shares personal experiences of living with developmental disabilities – training and encouraging their peers to speak out on issues important to them.  The groups motto, “Nothing About Us without Us,” is one Quality Trust fully endorses.  Many members have joined boards, committees, work groups, and commissions that make decisions that affect their lives.  Self-advocates meet to learn about their rights, update each other on important issues and events, practice speaking up and sharing their opinions, learn how to lead meetings, set priorities, provide and receive training and celebrate their achievements.

While DC has a Hypothermia Hotline, many of our guests do not feel safe in emergency shelter environments, and there is not support for their transition through homelessness, only maintenance of their status quo.

Our Hypothermia/Transition Program is application based, and each applicant meets with his Case Manager to ensure commitment to the goals and structure of the Program. Men are approved for participation in the Program based on an assessment of their readiness to move toward the next step on their journey out of homelessness, whether that step is a job, a temporary or permanent housing situation, or stability on the road to sobriety or mental health.

We open on November 1st and operate every night until March 31. The Hypothermia/Transition Program offers the men shelter for the night, a shower, a home-cooked evening meal, and time to work on their personal plan or to socialize.

The Program has two exceptional characteristics: it builds a cohort and it reintroduces family interactions.

Each year we provide shelter for a consistent group of 18-20 men. This is not a drop-in program, rather the same men join us each night until they find stable housing or reunite with their community. This opportunity to build a bond of trust in a predictable environment cannot be underestimated. The state of homelessness is characterized by chaos and, too often, by fear. We believe the Hypothermia/Transition Program offers a place of not just physical shelter. It also provides a mental and emotional place of safety that allows each man to focus on moving his life forward.

The success of the Hypothermia/Transition Program is made possible by the consistent and loving support of the Gonzaga Mothers’ Club (GMC). Each season, the GMC and their families commit to cooking and serving the evening meal for 20 men for over 150 nights! Even more remarkable, this is not simply a drop-off service. The meals are brought to the Center by families, who then stay to serve and eat with the men. The act of breaking bread together, sharing conversation, and engaging as brothers and sisters in Christ breaks down barriers and allows everyone at the tables to see each other as individuals. This removal of the us/them divide is a tremendous gift for both our guests and our volunteers.",1209121324412172,https://fathermckennacenter.org/what-we-do/hypothermia-program/,,info@fathermckennacenter.org,Verified,929094559121639,"Have to be approved in an application process.

Our Workforce Development Program is a holistic, intensive, and highly personalized approach to preparing adults to enter the workforce and advance in their careers. As with all our efforts to end poverty, our workforce readiness programming is rooted in the power of connections. Partnerships with community employers are key to connecting job seekers with jobs and area businesses with excellent staff members.

Boot Camps and Workshops

Topics include goal setting, conflict resolution, and phone etiquette, as well as hands-on support and practice with resume writing, cover letters, and interviewing. Following the Boot Camp, each job seeker is paired with a job coach from the community.

Boot Camp workshops are held six times a year at A Wider Circle’s Professional Development Center

For job seekers who cannot attend our Boot Camp (and for Boot Camp graduates who would like a refresher), we offer workshops and one-to-one job search assistance appointments during which participants get personalized attention from volunteers.

Neighbors First Individuals follows the Housing First model, which removes all barriers to housing, including sobriety requirements, and places participants directly into their own apartments from the street or shelters using a scattered site approach. Once housed, wraparound case management support addresses the medical, psychiatric, substance use, and/or employment needs of the participant.

The Housing First model welcomes participants “as they are” and favors flexibility over rules. It is person-centered, nonjudgmental, and non-coercive. The participants themselves drive the process, while case managers are there to help them achieve individual goals such as recovery, health, financial stability, education, reconnection with family, or employment.

Imagining healing is one of the most challenging tasks asked of a survivor. The word itself conjures the visual of a spinning turntable as one navigates feelings of hopelessness, shame, anger, fear, doubt and anxiety. The wreckage caused by trauma can easily overwhelm and paralyze us, making us feel stuck and keeping us in crisis.

DCRCC is committed to the belief that everyone can heal from trauma. We work to preserve individual agency in one’s healing. We seek to build a hub of resources to enable individuals to have more models and greater access to tools and support.

Individuals served by the public mental health system are dying, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population. This is largely due to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, and other obesity- and smoking-related diseases. These illnesses are worsened by years of malnutrition, living out in the harsh elements, and limited access to preventive health care. Pathways to Housing DC originated as a mental health and substance abuse provider. We have grown our partnerships with primary care providers and other local nonprofits over the past few years, recognizing that physical health and mental health are inextricably linked. We are committed to growing life expectancy and improving the health of the individuals we serve.

Timely access to healthcare and health education greatly impact an individual’s ability to recover, live longer, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We currently provide integrated mental health and primary care services to all Pathways clients through an on-site, walk-in clinic via our partnership with Unity Health Care (the District’s largest Federally Qualified Health Center).

We offer drug and alcohol-free residential settings that use the influence of the community consisting of treatment staff and those in recovery, as key agents of change.

In addition to using the concept of community as treatment method, the TC employs the principle of “self-help.” Self-help implies that the individuals in treatment are the main contributors to the change process. “Mutual self-help” means that individuals also assume partial responsibility for the recovery of their peers – an important aspect of an individual’s own treatment. The stages of treatment reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility. We use a variety of group processes to help individuals learn and assimilate social values and develop more effective social skills.

Our TC is centered on cultural values. Recognizing that a client’s culture is an inseparable part of his or her self-image, we provide clients information to combat what Dr. Carter G. Woodson* described as the “mis-education” that has shaped their lives. This information is vital in helping clients to clarify who they are and to place themselves as worthy citizens.

The Project was named for its founding Director, Barbara McDowell, after her untimely death.

The Project not only litigates appeals on behalf of Legal Aid clients but also files “friend of the court” briefs on cases involving matters of importance to people living in poverty. Beyond litigation, the Project provides appellate instruction, consultation, and advice to the larger D.C. legal services community. Although most of the Project’s work involves cases before the District’s highest court – the District of Columbia Court of Appeals – the Project also gets involved in administrative appeals and cases before the District of Columbia Superior Court and the federal courts.

Learn more about Barbara McDowell, the renowned appellate litigator and U.S. Supreme Court advocate who served as the project’s first director and after whom our appellate advocacy project is named.

After Barbara’s untimely death, Legal Aid created the Barbara McDowell Endowment Fund for Appellate Litigation with funds donated both from Barbara’s estate and from the generous donations of her husband, Jerry Hartman. The Fund was created “to honor the immeasurable contributions that Barbara made to Legal Aid and the legal needs of persons living in poverty in the District of Columbia.” Jerry has continued to donate generously in Barbara’s honor to the Fund to sustain the ongoing, important work of The Barbara McDowell Appellate Advocacy Project. Jerry also founded The Barbara McDowell and Gerald S.

And being a poor older adult in Washington DC is a huge challenge, largely because of the price of rentals in the city. In addition, Hispanic older adults never knew about the social benefits offered by the federal or city government, and even when they know there is some benefit, it is difficult for them to apply for the benefit because they cannot read the documents that They explain the benefits, cannot fill out the forms, or do not know how to follow those procedures. To face this tangle of procedures, Vida has a Social Services Counselor. All participants of Vida Senior Centers receive help from our counselors to apply for affordable housing, transportation and social benefits for programs that benefit older adults.

Support and Inpatient Services
We recognize how challenging a child’s illness can be for the entire family, especially when parents cannot see what’s wrong. Mental illness and psychiatric conditions are particularly complex because there are many factors that may influence your child’s emotions and behaviors. As well, the signs and symptoms of a psychiatric condition are often different between younger children and teens.

Our multidisciplinary team is composed of pediatric psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, academic counselors, psychologists, and expressive (art) therapists, who see to all aspects of care. They have extensive experience in the specialized care and treatment of children and teens with complicated emotional and behavioral disturbances.

To do this, VIDA has a licensed nutritionist / dietitian who supervises the food services of our participants. Our nutritionist also offers nutritional and diet counseling individually and in groups. The nutritionist works in coordination with the Health Promotion Counselor to put emphasis on people with high risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. Individual and group counseling are done with the objective of helping participants establish a healthy diet, by promoting informed decisions regarding their food. It is always emphasized that a healthy diet helps prevent and manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In addition to the classes, the nutritionist also offers demonstrates of healthy cooking. Depending on the season and seasonal vegetables or fruits, healthy meals are prepared. The nutritionist regularly uses food from the Food Bank box so that we teach participants how to use those ingredients in the healthiest way possible. Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels. In addition to that, VIDA gives breakfast to 50 participants in our two centers. We do not have a subsidy to provide breakfast, but for the past year VIDA has obtained private donations of bread and cereals that allow us to deliver breakfast in the morning to 50 people. In addition, we offer free lunch to about 120 people daily. Thanks to the support of the Washington DC Department of Aging, we deliver around 120 hot lunches daily between our two centers, Monday through Friday. Additionally, Vida Senior Center is an official distributor of the city's Food Bank, with which we distribute to each participant one meal box per month. In summary, nutrition and food activities are as follows:

• Free light breakfast: coffee / tea and bread or oatmeal
• Free lunches
• Individual nutrition assessments
• Individual diet tracking
• Group classes on nutrition
• Healthy food demonstrations
• Monthly distribution of a Food Bank box

RSP-SB Services are grounded in evidence-based treatment models such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), play therapy, and mindfulness. The program empowers children and adolescents by highlighting their existing strength.  Throughout the school year, RSP clinicians facilitate group and individual therapy services using games, art, experiential activities, writing, and other modalities that explain concepts to participants in developmentally appropriate ways.

RSP-HB Services are designed to supplement RSP-SB Services by engaging entire families in the treatment process.  Using the trauma adapted family connections (TA-FC) model, RSP clinicians also aim to help families improve access to needed resources, increase safety skills, reduce youth absenteeism from school, and/or improve youth grades over a period of six months.  RSP clinicians build on the treatment models used in RSP-SB Services by incorporating principles from narrative therapy, motivational interviewing, and family systems therapy to work toward goals established with each family.

As part of the Health Promotion program, our counselors routinely check the participants who register daily: their pressure is measured; their blood sugar levels are monitored; and their vital signs are supervised. Due to the high preparation of our counselors, when it is detected that the participant requires a medical appointment, the participants are referred to an appointment with their primary doctor or the needed specialist, if the case requires so. VIDA works with 7 hospitals in the city to which our counselors refer the participants when necessary. If the participant needs it, our social service counselor helps the participant to make the medical appointment. Sometimes the language barriers require this type of support. We also have a medication monitoring program to teach participants to know the benefits and side effects of the medications they take, so that they can understand the impact of their medications and identify if there is a problem. As part of the “Medication Monitoring Program”, a personalized follow-up of each person who enrolls in the program is carried out and a medication organizer pill is provided free of charge, so that they learn to take their medications on time and also learn to realize when they forget to take their pills.

Mood disorders can have wide-ranging effects on children, teens and their families. The toll on their physical health, performance in school, family and social relationships and overall well-being can be devastating.

Helping Children and Teens with Mood Disorders
The Mood Disorders Program at Children’s National Health System is dedicated to helping children and teens with mood disorders live as happily and healthfully as possible. We personalize care for each patient and family to ensure children receive the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes.

Features of our program include:

Expert pediatric specialists. When a child or teen’s negative feelings don’t go away, our highly trained pediatric specialists have the expertise and experience to recognize mood disorders and provide the care they need. That includes pediatricians, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and others.
Family-centered care. Our multi-specialty team knows that you know your child best. We value your input and work closely with your family to include you as a part of your child’s care team. This ensures he or she receives the most comprehensive and individualized care.
Ongoing support and education. We strive to empower preteens and their families diagnosed with mild to moderate depression to learn about the disorder that is impacting their lives. Group sessions that include art therapy and other tools help you work together toward recovery and wellness.
Finding new ways to help. Learning more about the factors that can lead to depression and other mood disorders in school-age children can improve their treatments and outcomes. Our researchers are committed to discovering new ways to identify, prevent and treat these disorders. Some of our patients participate in clinical trials. You can find out more by speaking with your child’s doctor, nurse, or other care team member.
Conditions We Treat
At Children’s National, we treat a wide range of mood disorders, including:

Major depression. A serious condition that involves persistent sadness, hopelessness and other symptoms
Bipolar disorder. A type of depression that also includes severe mood changes to extreme elation and happiness
Dysthymic disorder. Depression that is less severe but more long-lasting than major depression
Anxiety disorder. Excessive worry that doesn’t get better and can interfere with daily activities
Children and teens with mood disorders may have:

Difficult relationships with family and friends
Trouble sleeping
Changes in eating patterns or weight
Extreme temper outbursts
Low energy
Poor concentration
Aggressive behaviors
Mood disorders can cause other symptoms as well. Parents are in a unique position to see behavior changes and problems in their children. We take your concerns seriously and listen carefully to your observations.

Services We Offer
We start with a thorough evaluation, which can last two sessions or more, depending on your needs. Your pediatric specialist will talk with you about your child’s symptoms, your family health history and any other psychological concerns you may have. To give us more details about your child’s condition, we may ask your family to fill out forms known as objective scales. In some cases, teachers are also asked to complete these scales.

With an accurate diagnosis, we design a specific plan to provide the best care for each child. Follow-up care may involve:

Individual therapy
Family therapy
Medication, when necessary
We want you to be confident in your child’s care. To that end, we also provide second opinion evaluations and consultations.",1282604214927911,https://childrensnational.org/departments/mood-disorders-program,,,,941516382466411,"We see children and teenagers from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region and across the nation.

329,810358604812792,"Behavioral & Mental Health",,1168436736852155,"When aging, it is sometimes inevitable that older adults have a life without much company. Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person. When the situation requires the intervention of a doctor, Vida Senior Centers refers the participant to a specialized center. For this, VIDA has been coordinating with several local organizations specialized in mental health medical treatments. In summary, the activities offered as part of our Mental Health program are as follows:

• Individual counseling to handle stress situations
• Group counseling on frustration management techniques
• Tai-Chi exercises to learn to breathe and relax the body
• Classes on Positive Thinking
• Classes on Mental and Emotional Health

These older neighbors are unable to play an active role in society because of their homebound status, which results in them becoming ""invisible"" and, consequently, this all too often leads to situations in which they are taken advantage of because of their decreased mobility and limited support network.

Project HELP utilizes a full-time staff attorney, para-professional support, volunteers, and a cadre of volunteer (pro bono) attorneys from private law firms and government organizations.

- Interview clients at home regarding legal problems;
- Draft or review legal documents that seniors may need, such as powers of attorney or wills;
- Administer a public-benefits checkup;
- Assist clients with securing and maintaining public benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Elderly and Persons with Physical Disabilities (EPD) Waiver, Medicare, Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
- Assist clients whose benefits or services have been threatened with termination, terminated, decreased or overpaid, through representation at all stages of the appeal process including personal conferences, requests for reconsideration, and fair hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). 
- Analyze their housing situation concerning any landlord problems or consumer problems or, in the case of homeowners, any problems with home repair, predatory lending or deed fraud;
- Ensure proper follow-up on the identified legal problems either directly or via LCE’s other program initiatives.

Volunteers
We are always looking for volunteers! We have a special need for attorneys and notaries, but anyone can volunteer to serve as a witness when we finalize important documents in seniors' homes.

If you are an attorney licensed in the District of Columbia, please consider taking a case from us pro bono. We have many homebound seniors who need legal assistance. Our staff often gives training presentations on basic estate planning at area law firms. Please let us know if you are interested in hosting a training session.
If you are a notary licensed in the District of Columbia, please consider volunteering to help our clients execute important documents. Periodically, we send emails to our volunteer notaries asking if they can meet us at certain times and places to notarize documents for our homebound clients.

LAYC offers its family-based or host home model for youth with short-term housing needs and youth who could benefit from long-term placement with a family.

Our short-term program (up to 21 days) provides emergency shelter to homeless and runaway youth, ages 12-17. LAYC recruits and trains English and Spanish-speaking individuals and families as host families to provide youth with safe, loving, and stable homes. As part of this program, biological families receive family preservation services.

FAMILY PRESERVATION (SHORT-TERM ONLY)
The goal of family preservation is to reunite youth with their families. Our staff makes every effort to mediate temporary conflicts that do not pose a long-term threat to the youth’s safety. Our staff provides in-home family counseling, parent skills development, and mental health treatment to youth. We work with families who may be experiencing difficulties with adolescent behavior problems and mental health concerns as well as the effects of abuse or neglect, trauma, and poverty. We typically work with the families of youth at risk of running away or who have run away and are housed with one of our host families for five weeks.

LONG-TERM (UP TO 18 MONTHS)
Our long-term program helps older homeless youth, 18-21, transition to adulthood in a loving home. Once a youth is placed in the home of a certified family, the program provides supportive services to the youth, the host family, and the youth’s biological family. These services include crisis intervention; individual, group, and family counseling; mental health assessments; advocacy; referrals; intensive case management; and transportation.",585101162574385,http://www.layc-dc.org/what-we-do/safe-housing/family-based-housing/,,,Verified,929094559121639,"REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUTH IN OUR FAMILY-BASED HOUSING PROGRAM

Quality Trust advocates meet with the members they support as often as necessary to get to know them, their preferences and desired outcomes. They work with the family, government, and other stakeholders to keep the focus on the individual and what they desire.
Advocacy allows us to learn more about people with disabilities and the systemic issues in the city. We identify issues including healthcare education and life choice planning and offer disability support professionals best-practices training on how to better support people live positive, person-centered lives.

We provide trauma interventions, mindfulness and art therapy to help improve outcomes in the clients we serve. Patients can achieve a lasting recovery with support from peers and a highly trained staff.

Intensive Outpatient & Partial Hospitalization Program
Both the IOP & PHP programs offer a structured daily schedule consisting of evidence-based group therapy and a variety of hands-on art therapy, recreation and expressive activities. We help adults experiencing mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, bipolar diagnoses, or anxiety return to a healthy daily routine that incorporates self-care, social interaction, and mindfulness.

The Partial Hospitalization Program provides an intense, structured treatment setting for individuals who would benefit from daily therapeutic interventions or who would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care.

Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP)
Intensive Outpatient clients come to the PIW Day Center from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm three days a week for psychiatric services and group therapy sessions. While multiple groups are offered licensed clinicians work with each IOP client to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the client’s strengths, diagnosis and identified opportunities for growth and skill building.

During treatment, patients generally attend 3 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the client’s treatment plan.

Partial Hospitalization Treatment (PHP)
The Partial Hospitalization Program runs five days per week, five hours each day 9:00am to 2:00pm, plus a 30 minute lunch break.  Each day:

Begins with a community meeting group to review the daily schedule
Welcomes any new individuals
Reviews progress on treatment goals
Addresses any concerns or challenges
During treatment, patients generally attend 4 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the patient’s treatment plan.

Trauma Recovery & Empowerment Model
The Day Center at PIW utilizes an evidence based approach called The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). TREM is a fully manualized, group-based intervention designed to facilitate trauma recovery among women with histories of exposure to sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Drawing on cognitive restructuring, psychoeducational, and skills-training techniques, the intervention emphasizes the development of coping skills and social support. It addresses both short-term and long-term consequences of violent victimization and neglect, including mental health symptoms, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse.

Mindfulness
The Day Center at PIW utilizes the practice of Mindfulness to support clients in their healing. Mindfulness is an integrative, mind-body based approach that helps people to manage their thoughts, feelings and mental health. It has become widely used in a range of contexts to support emotional health and awareness.

Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment, using techniques like meditation, breathing, and yoga. Training helps people to become more aware of their thoughts, feelings and body sensations so that instead of being overwhelmed by them, they are better able to manage them. Practicing mindfulness can give more insight into emotions, boost attention and concentration as well as improve relationships.",1289140698414142,https://psychinstitute.com/treatment-services/adults/the-day-center/,,,Verified,"637158405241810,941516382466411","PIW’s Day Center Program has evidence-based treatment and skill enhancement to improve a person’s ability to function in daily life.

Capacity to fully participate
Reasonable expectation of improvement
A history of trauma (TREM Program for women)

A good education is fundamental to achieving financial independence as well as a successful career. Covenant House Washington offers a flexible GED preparation program that allows young people ages 18-24 to follow their dreams by successfully completing their high school education.  Our curriculum focuses on the mastery of subject matter tested during the GED exam- Science, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Language Arts.  Our experienced and compassionate teachers and volunteers work closely with youth, offering one-on-one tutoring and mentoring to ensure confidence and educational success.

Covenant House provides youth with transportation assistance to and from our Community Service Center as well as well as meals and childcare (for youth who are eligible) to help alleviate barriers to attending classes.

Covenant House Washington’s Job Readiness Career Center (JCRC) helps young people gain skills in a specific vocation and also learn what they need to know about job hunting and the professional world.  Skills taught to young people include:

Interviewing
Resume Building
Workplace Ethics & Behavior
Proper Workplace Attire
Computer Skills
Networking
Effective Communication
Helping our youth find jobs is the most important step to ensuring their financial independence and future success.  Our staff are sensitive to the fears that young people experience when it comes to looking for employment and handling the responsibility that keeping a job requires. They know that not all the answers can be found in a classroom or a textbook, so they make themselves available to youth by listening to their concerns and offering reassurance.

They also know that they can take a much needed break while their older family member is at the Center. Our families regularly tell us how grateful and relieved they feel once their loved one is attending Misler. The respite from their own caregiving responsibilities means that they will be better able to provide needed care at home.

Social work staff also supports caregivers through their knowledge of community resources to help families with their caregiving responsibilities. Whether it is a referral to a community based professional such as a neurologist, or a roster of credible home care agencies, we are there to help you meet the needs of your loved ones, today and in the future. We draw on the resources of JCA programs such as the Senior HelpLine or Connect-A-Ride Information and Referral to link families to the services they need.

Our social workers lead a caregiver support group that meets twice a month. Under the gentle facilitation of our licensed social worker, families find a haven – a place to talk with others who are experiencing very similar challenges.

This abuse can be physical, verbal or emotional. It can have devastating effects on the child. In some cases children who are bullied try to commit suicide.

While bullying can happen at any age, it’s more likely to occur among school children. Both those who are bullied and those who bully others can have serious health problems as a result.

The Program for Health Problems Related to Bullying at Children’s National Health System offers professional evaluation and treatment for children and teens affected physically or mentally by bullying.

We are passionately committed to improving the lives of these children. In addition, we’re dedicated to prevention and we work hard in the community to inform the public about bullying and the health risks it causes.

Each year we welcome young people from colleges, schools, parishes, and other programs who not only serve as volunteers, but also live at The Father McKenna Center for a week at a time. This program is often an Alternative Spring Break or an Outreach Program for students who come to the Center on Saturday or Sunday, and stay through the following weekend.

Our volunteers are not bystanders, rather they eat their meals in common with the men we serve, work in the Center, and support all aspects of our program. They sleep in the program area in the former church basement (often on pews or air mattresses they bring), take time to reflect on their experiences of service, and often have supplementary learning experiences at other organizations that support people experiencing homelessness (e.g. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless). The week of service frequently culminates in a day of advocacy as our visitors meet with their representatives or staff in the US Congress – just steps away from The Father McKenna Center.

We believe the experience of immersive service plays a vital role in breaking down societal barriers, teaches about individuals as well as issues, and equips our young visitors with tools for compassionate engagement as they return to their own communities.

As one of our visitors from The University of Notre Dame observed, “When I arrived, the homeless were a demographic. Now, they are people. A brother or a sister to me.”",1209121324412172,https://fathermckennacenter.org/what-we-do/immersion-service-learning-program/,,info@fathermckennacenter.org,Verified,789038541797078,"Call for more information.",,,,,1123859846194392,,,883345659611536,645829762063748,,,

As one of the few Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) treatment providers in Washington, DC, Andromeda is uniquely positioned to provide MAT for opioid dependent persons with unmet treatment needs for substance use and co-occurring mental health disorders.

Andromeda’s staff has decades of experience in working with persons with opioid dependence. Staff provides a safe space, inclusive of empathy for the consequences of addiction.

They also refer patients to the array of educational health and social services that are available in the DC metro area.

Andromeda patients that have been in the program have turned their lives around, working, living free of drugs and reestablishing healthy relationships.

Hypothermia Outreach Team (HOT)

In January 2013, GMC partnered with Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice to create a volunteer hypothermia outreach team (HOT). These volunteers, made up of students, faculty, and staff, do street outreach on behalf of GMC on the coldest nights to check on those unwilling to go to shelters. They let people know about what warming sites are available, distribute cold-weather accessories, and check for signs and symptoms of hypothermia.

The Hypothermia Outreach Team was featured on NPR and Georgetown University put together this informational video. Take a few minutes to listen, watch and learn more about how the team works and how they interact with people on the street.

Saving Lives Through Street Outreach

Often, we encounter the same individuals week after week during our street outreach rounds. We always stop to say hello and ask if they need anything from us, and often the most service-resistant individuals will always dismiss us. “No, I’m fine. I don’t need anything.” Still, we persist week after week and become a familiar face and trusted source for help.

Mickey was a man we encountered every week sitting outside of the same store in Georgetown. We’d always say hello and ask if he needed anything, but he’d always say no, and we’d move on.

One day when we were walking with Dr. Crosland, our general practitioner, Mickey switched his answer from no to yes. He wanted us to check his blood pressure, which we found out was alarmingly high. Mickey let us call an ambulance for him, and we later found out that he was suffering from a heart attack. Mickey stayed in the hospital for several days before being discharged.

This is why we continue to do street outreach week after week and talk to people, even if they always tell us they don’t need help. One day, they might, and we want to be there for them when they do.",865999041296626,https://georgetownministrycenter.org/programs/street-outreach/,,info@gmcgt.org,Verified,"929094559121639,637158405241810","Call for more information.

583,1095230986476849,"Gender Development Program",,1061724977026001,"A Multidisciplinary Program for Gender-Diverse Youth and Their Families 
Some young people feel, sense or know they are a gender different than the one they were assumed at birth. They may live and dress in ways typical of another gender (gender non-conformity), and some may experience the need to live and be affirmed as this gender in some or all settings. This can be an urgent need, or for others, there may be experimentation and exploration. There are also some young people who show gender non-conformity in their everyday behaviors, but may not yet have the self-advocacy skills to discuss their gender identity and their gender-related needs. Each child's gender journey is unique.

The gender development of a child may be confusing to parents and families, providers, and sometimes young people themselves. Parents may wonder:

How can my child's gender-related needs best be supported?
How do we navigate our child's gender diversity in everyday life (e.g., with family, in school, when moving into adulthood, etc.)?
Is my child transgender?
Will my child's gender and gender-related needs change over time?
The needs of gender-diverse youth are often complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and ongoing care supports over time.

About Us
The Gender Development Program at Children's National has been supporting the gender needs of youth and their families for the past 20 years. As one of the earliest founded youth gender programs, we are a multidisciplinary team of specialists who work in the assessment and broad care needs of youth on the gender spectrum and their families. We also conduct cutting-edge research to move forward our understanding of youth gender development and ways to best support gender-diverse and transgender youth. Research findings inform all of our clinical care.

We work with gender exploring, gender non-conforming, gender dysphoric, gender non-binary, transgender and gender-questioning young people, and we see children and adolescents of all ages. We also work with youth who have genetic and other conditions in which gender variation is common.

We offer:

Personalized evaluations and tailored care: This includes evaluation of your child's gender development and needs in the real world. Throughout care with us, your child will receive supports tailored to their unique needs, in coordination with an existing community of professionals your child already sees to ensure continuity and consistency of care.
Comprehensive services and collaboration with multiple specialties: From initial and ongoing evaluation and support to specialists in medical treatments such as Veronica Gomez-Lobo, M.D., a pediatric gynecologist who provides medical interventions such as puberty suppression or hormone therapy, the program offers a full spectrum of care options based on the needs of each young person.
Unique programs for diverse needs:
Children and teens who have both autism spectrum characteristics (or related conditions) and gender dysphoria have access to a support program designed specifically for them: the Gender and Autism Program led by John Strang, Psy.D. Many providers refer patients to our program to access these services, which may not be offered elsewhere.
The Gender Development Program works closely with the Youth Pride Clinic, which offers primary and specialty care services to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer) patients.
Evaluation and Ongoing Supports
Your child’s care will start with an initial evaluation by our team. During this two to three-hour visit, you will meet the team together with your child and also separately. The goals of these visits vary from family to family and may include:

Understanding the various aspects of your child’s gender development
Screening for any mental health concerns/risks
Support for parenting a gender diverse child
Support for families navigating issues related to siblings, friends, school, etc.
We may ask you and your child to return for periodic follow-up visits. These visits can help us make a more extended evaluation. Your team also may suggest treatments or supportive services through Children’s National or in the community such as:

Individual supports for youth and/or parents
Family-specific supports
School supports/interventions

Families who graduate from the HF program have healthier children and better parent-child interactions. Less than 1% of these families are found to later abuse their child. The program has four goals:
1. Promote positive parenting
2. Improve child health and development
3. Promote school readiness
4. Prevent child abuse and neglect

Healthy Families provides two main types of services: Family Assessment and Home Visits. A Family Resource Specialist conducts an initial Family Assessment based on the Kempe Family Stress Checklist to determine eligibility for the program as well as need for other services within the community. Depending on indicated need, the Resource Specialist provides parents with referrals to community resources. If admitted into the program, Family Support Workers provide regular Home Visits to at-risk families beginning during pregnancy and until child reaches the age of three years.

Home Visiting Services:
​Family Goal Planning: families develop family goal plans, which are updated regularly according to family needs.
Parenting Education: Parents learn about positive family interaction from the Parents as Teachers curriculum, which is activity-based and builds upon parents’ growing knowledge of child development.
Health Education: Parents get information on healthcare, family planning, immunizations, and other resources.

These levels of achievement include legal, medical, employment, social, educational, and relationship building. Residents may stay in ETLP housing for up to 6 years. Residents must be enrolled in school, work part-time, and save portions of their income. Some also contribute to their rent.

Project End:
If you have tried to get help from the wrong in people in the past, we can help.

Project END (Eradicating Notario Deceit) is a direct legal services project aimed at remedying the harm caused by notario or immigration consultant fraud. Project END provides advice, counsel, and representation to victims in civil, criminal, and immigration proceedings.

A notario, notario público, or immigration consultant in the U.S. is not an attorney nor an accredited representative of the Department of Justice in the U.S., and consequently, is not licensed to provide paid immigration legal advice or legal services. Unscrupulous notarios or consultants routinely prey on immigrants who, because of linguistic, cultural, and financial obstacles, believe a notario or consultant can assist them with their legal issues. The fraudulent work of notarios or immigration consultants can have life-devastating consequences on its victims, including financial ruin, damage to a legal case, deportation, and permanent family separation.

Follow-up visits are scheduled, often every four weeks, so the doctor can determine how well the medication is working and whether or not there are any troubling side effects. The doctor works alongside one of our nurses, who also checks for physical conditions. The nurse often makes referrals to the client’s primary care provider and follows up to make sure that the client’s health is optimal.

The Crime Victims Assistance Partnership (CVAP) seeks to educate, support, and assist victims and their families with the financial burden brought about by the tragic occurrence and aftermath of violent crime in the District of Columbia. CVAP assists with reimbursement or direct payment to providers for services necessary as a result of crime (such as medical treatment) that are not covered by sources such as private insurance, medical aid programs, or other benefits.

CVAP, led by the Asian Pacific American Legal Resource Center, consists of the D.C. Crime Victim Compensation Office, the Mayor’s Office of Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs, the Metropolitan Police Department (Asian Liason Unit), and other community partners. The program is funded by the Office of Victim Services of the Executive Office of the Mayor. Through CVAP, APALRC’s services include educating the Asian Pacific American community about public safety, reporting crimes, and assisting victims with applying for crime victim compensation. Since the project began in 2001, the APALRC has screened over 600 victims and has assisted nearly 100 Asian victims applying for compensation.

If You Have Been a Victim of a Crime in DC

If you have been a victim of a crime that occurred in the District of Columbia and have been determined to be eligible for compensation through CVCP, the APALRC can help with the application process and case management. This may include payment for medical costs, lost wages, and other compensation costs that have directly resulted from being a victim of a crime.

For families who have had multiple experiences with homelessness, they find stability and a home in our permanent supportive housing program. The majority of families live in their own apartments across the city, while some live in a single apartment building. This program provides long-term housing and in-home supportive services to formerly chronically homeless families.

These programs are based on Housing First, a nationally successful model that focuses on helping individuals and families move into and sustain permanent housing – along with a variety of services to promote stability, self-sufficiency and well-being.

We place families into permanent homes and provide them with the tools they need to focus on their life goals, including:

In-home, goal-oriented case management
Assistance on finding an affordable apartment
Connection to employment and training
Navigation through school and life challenges for their children
Pairing eligible youth with volunteer mentors
Connection to community resources
A team of staff – with expertise in the areas of case management, housing, employment and youth – work with the parents and children in each family to help them achieve those goals.

Pathways to Housing DC’s Supported Employment program was developed out of the same philosophy as our Housing First model: just as we believe that anyone who wants housing is “housing ready”, anyone who says they want a job is “employment ready.” When someone tells us that they want to work, our Supported Employment team immediately leaps into action to help them find and retain employment in Washington, DC and the surrounding region. The team provides assistance and support throughout the job search, application, interview, and onboarding process.  That support continues into each person’s new career, for as long as it is needed, with teams offering counsel and advice as each person adjusts to their new work routine. Our Supported Employment program also operates quarterly workshops, as well as other ongoing support services that are tailored to each individual’s needs.

ABOUT THE VETERANS LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT

The Veterans Legal Assistance Project (VLAP) provides free civil legal assistance to low-income veterans in the DC region. Often homeless and disabled, these veterans lack the most basic essentials: safe and affordable housing, healthcare, subsistence income or a job and protection from exploitation or violence. Many of their problems have legal dimensions and can be alleviated or resolved with the help of a lawyer.

Launched in 2015 in response to a fragmented and inadequate network of legal assistance for destitute veterans, the VLAP provides a gateway to legal and other services for this highly vulnerable population. An NLSP Staff attorney serves as the VLAP Project Manager. The project is overseen by the Capital Area Veterans Legal Services Collaborative, a group of legal services providers and law firms in the DC area who seek to improve the accessibility, scope and delivery of effective, free civil legal services to homeless and low-income veterans.","931728525653879,1053529725692782,647497712481280",http://www.nlsp.org/services/veterans,," veterans.project@nlsp.org",Verified,917725171609009,"Call or walk in during intake hours for an intake.

The Program is designed to support men on their journey through homelessness, in keeping with our mission of Meeting Needs… Reclaiming Lives.

Men struggling with homelessness face a range of obstacles. The Father McKenna Center has a well-developed program of services and strategies to support our guests, balancing small goals with high expectations. The ultimate goal of our work is to help each man reach his full potential. Our approach is to meet each person where he is and support him as he works toward a life of stability, productivity, meaning, and hope.

In any week we have over 250 unique guests (in the course of a year more than 1,800 different men spend time at the Center). They range in age from early 20’s to over 80, and are of every race, color and creed, although the overwhelming majority are African American.

Reflecting the diverse impact of homelessness, some men are well educated, while others do not have a high school diploma. We see men suffering from mental illness, struggling with addiction, and isolated from their families. Some men are coming home from incarceration, others are new to the DC area. In each man we see a unique person, beloved of God, deserving of grace, and imbued with innate dignity.

We provide:
Structured case management, including counseling, an accountability program, and referrals for mental and physical health assessments.
A men’s support group meeting every day, attendance is a pre-requisite for Midday Meal at the Center. These facilitated sessions challenge and encourage, while building a strong peer network within a community where trust is rare.
Substantial breakfast and home-cooked hot lunch, served by volunteers and shared with love.
Showers and laundry service, supporting our guests in maintaining personal hygiene and the self-respect which that reflects and conveys.
Use of a phone and secure cell phone charging.

But for some children and even infants, difficulties in personality or mood can be more serious. These problems are sometimes related to a medical condition or to a developmental delay. They also may result from a traumatic event.

Whatever the cause, we understand how stressful and confusing it can be when your young child is having trouble. We are here to help relieve these problems in children up to age 5, and prevent them from worsening as children grow up.

Why Choose Us
At the Infant and Toddler Mental Health Program (ITP) at Children’s National Health System, we diagnose personality and mood conditions early and design treatments specifically for your child. Features of our program include:

Unique, specialized psychiatric services for young children. We are one of only a few providers in the region specializing in psychiatric treatment for preschool-age children and in specialized therapies for this age group such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a best practice therapeutic approach for young children with behavioral difficulties and their parents. Our feeding disorders clinic is one of only a few of its kind in the U.S. that specializes in treating infants and toddlers.
Compassionate, personalized care for each patient and family. Our Infant and Toddler Mental Health specialists consider each child’s individual situation and always treat you and your family as part of the team. We take the time to help you understand your child’s diagnosis and treatment and to answer any questions you may have. Our care supports your child’s emerging abilities and helps him or her grow into a healthy and happy child.
Internationally known for our results. The defining work on feeding disorders in young children was written by our director, Irene Chatoor, M.D.. Children who need specialized expertise and child-focused care are referred to us from the Washington, D.C., area, across the nation and around the world.
Close collaboration with skilled specialists. Our team works closely with a variety of specialists who add perspective to your child’s care. They can include occupational therapists and speech-language therapists, as well as experts from fields such as developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, autism spectrum disorder and sleep disorders.
Specialized Care
Identifying mental health issues in children is complex. Children’s National offers two care paths that draw on multiple resources for your child.

Comprehensive Assessment and Intervention
Comprehensive assessment and intervention services help with a broad range of behavioral issues and stressful conditions that may affect infants through the first years of life. Parents or medical providers, may have concerns about:

Aggression
Anxiety
Exposure to loss
Feeding problems
Irritability
Moodiness
Neglect
Sleeping difficulties
Violence
Withdrawn behavior
You child’s first meeting with specialists may last up to two hours. It will include a psychiatric assessment. At that time we observe your child during a play session and cleaning up toys afterward. After this meeting, we give general feedback and advice for parents.

The underlying reasons for a child’s distress and/or behaviors can be complex.

A thorough evaluation usually requires at least three visits. Afterward we may recommend or provide:

Connections to school and community resources. We provide referrals for school-based services, such as DC Early Stages, Maryland Child Find, and Virginia Infants and Toddlers Connections. We also work with school administrators to help them provide services for your child. That can include letters of recommendation for school-based interventions, such as individualized educational plans (IEP), and referrals to educational advocates such as the Children’s Law Center.
Daycare or preschool consultations
Individual treatment strategies. This can include highly effective approaches such as parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), which is provided by PCIT-certified therapist Leandra Godoy, Ph.D.. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) can result in positive behavior changes in children with autism spectrum disorder. We also may recommend play therapy.
Medication, if needed. Some children benefit from medications focused specifically on their condition. Psychiatrist Bhavin Dave, M.D., can prescribe the right medication for your child and monitor how he or she responds.
Multidisciplinary care. We can connect you and your child with other providers, such as specialists in autism spectrum disorder, developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, and occupational therapy. We may also refer your child to our Sleep Center.
Education for parents. Experts at Children’s National help parents understand how issues such as developmental delays and medical problems can lead to emotional or behavioral issues in young children. They also explain your child’s specific diagnosis and how it usually affects children as they grow.
Parenting support groups. Our parent support group gives parents an opportunity to share and learn from each other in an atmosphere of compassion, respect, confidentiality and mutual support.
Feeding Disorders
Our multidisciplinary feeding disorders team was established more than 15 years ago. Since then it has helped hundreds of families.

Feeding disorders in infants and young children under the age of 6 can come from a physical problem, an emotional issue or both. Assessment and care for infants and young children with these disorders can help them avoid health problems and improve their emotional well-being as they grow. Feeding disorders can include:
Overeating
Refusing to eat
Aversions to specific foods
Spitting up or vomiting in infants
Difficulty sucking or swallowing in infants
Gastro-esophageal reflux
Children with these problems may weigh too much or too little, or be normal weight. Infants may fail to gain weight and thrive. Older children may fall behind the normal growth curve.

New patients are first seen by a nurse specialist in gastroenterology. This nurse will consider your child’s medical, behavioral and nutritional issues. We also look at how well your child can control his or her lips, tongue and jaw muscles (oral-motor development). This screening will include a physical exam.

After the initial report from the nurse specialist, your child will have visits with specialists in several areas of care relevant to his or her condition. We may look further into his or her oral-motor and psychiatric issues. At this time, we will observe your child from behind a one-way mirror as he or she eats and plays.

Once we complete the comprehensive evaluation, the entire team meets with you to provide feedback. Our recommendations can include:

Guidance for parents in feeding management
Medical treatment
Oral-motor therapy

Although notary publics are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An impartial witness (the notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization. In the US (except Puerto Rico), any person – lawyer or otherwise – may be commissioned as a notary.





To ""notarize"" a document or event is not a term of art, and its definition varies from place to place; but it generally means the performance by a notary of a series of possible steps, which may include the following (not an exhaustive list):



Identifying the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity including passport, driving license, etc.[3]

Where land titles are involved or significant rights may accrue by reference to the identity, signatures may also be verified, recorded and compared.

Recording the proof of identity in the notarial register or protocol.

Satisfying the notary that the person appearing is of full age and capacity to do whatever is intended.

Taking an affidavit or declaration and recording that fact.

Taking detailed instructions for a protest of a bill of exchange or a ship's protest and preparing it.

Recording the signature of the person in the register or protocol.

Taking an acknowledgment (in the United States) of execution of a document and preparing a certificate of acknowledgement.

Preparing a notarial certificate (in most other jurisdictions) as to the execution or other step.

Sealing or stamping and signing the document.

Recording all steps in the register or protocol.

Delivering the completed original to the person appearing.

In some cases, retaining a copy of the document in the register or protocol.

 Central Union Mission serves veterans in numerous ways:

Shelter.  On average, 17 homeless veterans stay in the shelter each night.  Some are referred to the Mission by the Veterans Administration.  Through a no-cost Memorandum of Understanding with the VA, the Mission provides short-term housing for veterans while they participate in VA programs for homeless veterans.  Through this partnership, the Mission provided 1,195 nights of shelter to 48 veterans over the past year.  This is in addition to over 5,000 nights of shelter provided to veterans not referred by the VA.

 Food.  Through its food pantry, the Mission serves on average 35 veterans per month, providing each of them and their families with enough groceries for about 96 meals each month.  The Mission also serves 3 meals per day to homeless guests as well as other hungry people who walk in its doors, amounting to over 50 meals per day for veterans.  Altogether, the Mission provides over 58,000 meals to veterans per year.

Workforce Development Programs.  Approximately 2 veterans participate each year in the Mission’s Work Therapy Program and Ready2Succeed programs, that provide work readiness training, employs veterans in-house in the Mission’s homeless shelter and food pantry and in Mission-held contracts and entrepreneurial ventures.  The Mission employs each participant for 6 to 24 months and helps them secure unsubsidized jobs and housing.

MCMs provide in-depth counseling, crisis intervention, education, translation and ongoing support services and expertise through comprehensive assessment, planning, referral, and overall evaluation of individual patient needs.

They also learn skills like problem-solving and positive communication, which will help them have a better quality of life. Youth will learn positive ways to enjoy life without alcohol and drugs.

The Center has been meeting these needs since we were founded in 1983, and there is more demand than ever before.

The Food Pantry is open each weekday. Families seeking food assistance check-in with volunteers and have a shopping experience allowing them to select the products they want to meet their specific family’s needs. We find this approach to be rewarding – supporting healthy meals, the dignity of choice, and reducing waste.

Families may visit the Food Pantry as often as every two weeks. We provide food that supports more than 45,000 meals annually. The Food Pantry also builds community – the same families will regularly shop on the same schedule, building relationships with each other and the volunteers.

We believe that reducing a family’s anxiety about putting food on the table, allows space for the grace of sharing, conversation, and care around that table. In the words of our inspiration, Fr. Horace McKenna, “You cannot speak to a person about his or her soul, when they have no food.”

P2I is an intensive five-year commitment for families living below the poverty line, and we will launch the initial cohort in the fall of 2018. This cohort will include up to 100 families, each of which will be matched with Advocates (experienced Wider Circle staff members) and individual volunteers, who together will provide comprehensive, consistent, and long-term support.

The program is a part of A Wider Circle’s drive toward both a more outcomes-based approach and more client-centered programming. While our services continue to be in great demand and produce significant change for individuals and families, we, like many organizations across the country, yearn for more progress in supporting families’ efforts to rise out of poverty. We believe this program will contribute significantly to that end.

Participants will receive individualized planning support and a wide range of skill-building and educational opportunities. Select services include:

For the past decade, we have successfully engaged, housed, supported, and treated over 850 adults who had been living on the streets for years. As an alternative to a system of emergency shelter/ transitional housing, our model is simple: provide housing first, and then combine that permanent housing with supportive treatment services in the areas of mental and physical health, substance abuse, education, and employment.

While the model is simple, the Housing First Program is very complex and requires dedicated staff to coordinate all aspects (outreach, housing, healthcare, treatment and case management) of the program in order for the people we serve to be successful in their recoveries. Housing First means there are no conditions that have to be met before the person moves in. Housing is provided in apartments that are spread throughout the District, with each client holding their own lease. Using “scattered sites,” we are able to give each client choice in where they would like to live, helping to foster a sense of home and self-determination. Stable, supportive housing is merely the first step towards reintegrating into their community, rebuilding family relationships, reconnecting with their faith fellowships, and experiencing an improvement in overall physical health and psychological wellbeing.

After receiving housing first, every client is matched with a support team (Assertive Community Treatment Team, Veterans Housing First Team and/or Permanent Supportive Housing Team) comprised of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, certified addictions counselors, employment specialists, and peer health specialists. The team works together to provide comprehensive community-based treatment and support services around the clock, with a focus on integrating both health and social well-being into the recovery plan. These vital interventions are designed to empower client choice and support successful independent living. Using this model, we have been able to maintain a housing retention rate of at least 91% with clients who have traditionally been viewed as “treatment resistant,” and “not ready for housing.” We believe that housing is a basic human right, that anyone who says they want a safe place to live is “housing ready,” and that virtually all people can be successful in housing with the proper combination of supports. Our success using the Housing First model demonstrates that the vast majority of people we connect with permanent supportive housing stay in that housing and on the path to recovery.",743353111808252,https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/housing-first/,,,Verified,929094559121639,"We do not accept direct referrals for this program.

Through LIP, the APALRC recruits community members to go through a two-day training program on legal interpretation. The APALRC currently has a pool of 54 trained interpreters whose skills span 26 different Asian languages. Once a client is referred from the Helpline to a legal services organization, the APALRC is able to provide the client with a trained legal interpreter, thereby ensuring that language does not continue to present a barrier to services. The APALRC’s legal interpreters have assisted with on-site interpretation for attorney-client meetings, interpretation via telephone, and translation of affidavits and other documents.",1264011549910449,https://www.apalrc.org/legal-interpreter-project/,,,Verified,917725171609009,"Once referred for services, you will be offered this service.",,,,,1148564700806737,743786809520784,,884944905632896,1018319997039351,,,
